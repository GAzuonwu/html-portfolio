<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My encounter with computer dates back to the late 90s at Adventist Seminary of
  West Africa (now Babcock University), Nigeria.  Since then, my desire to make 
  best out of this special device has never had a rest.
</p>
<p>The recent has been to showcase, through the web, all meaningful, relevant
  and useful information for the globe through the web.  This has led to my 
  commitment to master web design and development.
